# Project: MyFridge

### MyFridge is a website designed to connect students from the same community to share food and recipes so as to
1) Reduce food waste
2) Provide a platform for students to interact and share cooked food and ingredients with others
3) Reduce time for food preparation

## Implementation
 To build this website, we have used html, php, css for the backbone of the website, and mySQL to retrieve the data from the tables in the database

## Challenges
 Being first years, we were all unsure of how to create a new website. Hence we were unsure how to start the project. Learning how to use the different platforms was one of the biggest challenges that we faced. We had many ideas and extensions that we wanted to implement but we were unsure of how to do so with the limited technical knowledge that we had. With the mentors' help, we were able to broaden our horizon and learn more about the different aspects of interface and web development software.

## Developers:
Azhara Assanova, Dhivya Ravindran, Jenny Zhang, Rosemary Ng and Tina Sandu - first year CS students at Imperial College London.
